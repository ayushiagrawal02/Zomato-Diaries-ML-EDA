Zomato Cost Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the approximate cost for two people at restaurants listed on Zomato using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features from the Zomato dataset, the model aims to provide accurate cost estimations, assisting users in making informed dining choices.

üìä Project Overview
Objective: To develop a predictive model that estimates the cost for two at restaurants based on features such as location, cuisine, and service availability.

Dataset: Utilizes the Zomato dataset, which includes information on restaurant details, services, and pricing.

Approach: Employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate the predictive model.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data inconsistencies, and standardized categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Transformed categorical variables using encoding techniques suitable for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions and relationships between variables to gain insights.

Model Building: Implemented regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, to predict costs.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

üìà Results
Best Model: Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy with an R-squared score of 0.85.

Insights:

Restaurants offering online orders tend to have higher average costs.

Certain cuisines are associated with higher pricing.

Location significantly influences the cost for two.
